## Topic: Traffic Crash in Michigan

### Work Plan
I will import data of traffic crashes in four counties(Ionia, Kent, Montcalm and Ottawa) in Grand Rapids Metropolitan area of Michigan between the years 2004 and 2020 and clean and preprocess it so that it can be analyzed. My plan is to build an interactive R shiny web app visualizing the different patterns of total traffic crashes, crashes involving alcohol and drugs, and the injury and death due to them and conduct the comparative analysis on basis of year and county.

### Understanding that will be gained
1. Importing and preprocessing data
2. Visualizing patterns of data  and execute comparative analysis
3. Understanding and implementing R programming and develop shiny web app.
